//WAP to Caesars Cipher

/*One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the mea/*nings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.*/

function rot13(str) {
  let alphabets = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
  let answer = "";

  for(let i=0;i<=str.length-1;i++){
    if(alphabets.indexOf(str[i])>=13){
      answer += alphabets[alphabets.indexOf(str[i])-13];
      console.log(answer);
    }else if(alphabets.indexOf(str[i])<13 && alphabets.indexOf(str[i])>-1 ){
      answer += alphabets[alphabets.indexOf(str[i])+13];
    }else{
      answer += str[i];
    }
  }
  return answer;
}

rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC");
